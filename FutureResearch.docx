AI-Powered Analytics and Predictive Insights
Your agent currently doesn't handle market analysis or risk prediction by analyzing data trends and property values, which can offer investors and real estate firms valuable insights for decision-making.

Regulatory Compliance and Monitoring
While your agent provides legal advice on compliance, it's not explicitly set up for compliance tracking and providing real-time updates on property laws, which could help clients maintain regulatory adherence.

Fraud Detection & Security
Although your agent assists in due diligence, there is no mention of fraud detection and secure transactions capabilities. This would involve identifying forged documents, misrepresentation, or suspicious transaction patterns.

Property Valuation & Investment Analysis
Your agent is not focused on automated property valuation models or providing investors with tools to analyze the profitability and risks of investments. This could be a valuable extension for property and investment evaluation.

Property Management & Tenant Services
Services related to lease management, tenant screening, and automating processes like rent collection and maintenance requests are not yet part of your agent's offerings. This would target landlords and property managers.

Transaction Management and Contract Execution (Escrow and Smart Contracts)
Your agent currently handles contract drafting and review but does not automate escrow management, fund transfers, or implement smart contracts for transaction automation, which could reduce errors and streamline processes using blockchain.

Title Management & Property Ownership
There's no explicit mention of automating title verification or utilizing blockchain for property ownership transparency and title insurance management, critical for clear property ownership and dispute prevention.

AI-Powered Smart Contracts
Your agent does not handle automated contract execution via smart contracts, which is another area where blockchain could be leveraged for secure and self-executing contracts based on predefined conditions.

Market Integration & Public Services
Your agent could expand by partnering with real estate platforms and public registries for seamless data integration and offer legal services directly on these platforms.

International Transactions & Cross-Border Investments
Currently, thereâ€™s no feature for handling cross-border compliance or assisting with international property transactions, which would appeal to investors dealing with real estate across different legal jurisdictions.
