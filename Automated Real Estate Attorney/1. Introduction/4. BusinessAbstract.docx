In simple words, the real estate business needs legal documents and advice. Usually a paralegal takes cares of these documents, but now a portal is made to automate these tasks. We have an UI which takes the input from the user and with the help of an agent deploy the application on the cloud. This agent is now grounded(integrated) with LLMs to produce more relevant and accurate outputs. This is send back into the portal, and this is our entire application.
